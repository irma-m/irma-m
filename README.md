# Hello! 👋 I'm Irma

I'm a full-stack developer with experience in both front-end and back-end development. I have a Master's degree in Data Science, and I've worked on projects that combine data analysis and software development. My expertise includes technologies like Python, JavaScript, and SQL, which I use to create efficient and innovative solutions.

I'm passionate about technology and always eager to learn new skills and connect with professionals in the field. I'm currently seeking new opportunities to apply my knowledge and continue growing as a developer.
